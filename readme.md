# 1st Bandar-log

The 1st Bandar-log is a group of [Scouting](https://scouts.org.uk/home/) and [Guiding](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/) mascots. Often small and cuddly creatures dressed in various scout/guide attire, coverted by young people and their leaders.

## Why Bandar-log?

The Bandar-Log are the "Monkey People" of the Jungle Book.  A group of monkeys that do not follow the Law of the Jungle, have no leader, and are considered outcasts of the Jungle.  Their slogan is *"We are great. We are free. We are wonderful. We are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and so it must be true."*

The 1st Bandar-log themselves have no true law or leader, and are often outcasts at group meetings. These mascots can often be found distracting young members from their activities and encouraging them to cause mischief.  Many mascots have been known to talk young people up climbing walls, across rivers and down tall cliffs when no leader can even get them to put on their shoes.

When [SSAGO](https://www.ssago.org/) Clubs attend a Rally they often bring their mascots along, but there is a history of club mascots being stolen. The only way for a club mascot to be returned is for the club concerned to perform a forfeit of some sort.
