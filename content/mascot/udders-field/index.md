Udders and Field are the Pennine Archers (in 'Uddersfield) Mascots!

They get up to all sorts of Mischief but don't like to be apart for too long. They're available for an exchange on a 'one cow at a time' basis.

Their favourite hobby is archery, and they can frequently be found inspecting people's arrows and supporting people when they're first giving it a go.
