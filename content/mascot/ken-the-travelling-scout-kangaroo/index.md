Hello, my name is Ken, I'm a Kangaroo and a Scout!

I was born in Australia in 2017 and as a young kangaroo I joined up with my friend [Kev Kanga](https://www.facebook.com/KevKanga) and travelled via Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland to the 15th World Scout Moot in Iceland.

One day I hope to travel some more and visit Scouts in other countries.  Find me on Facebook to see what I'm up to now.
