Hello, my name is Ken, I'm a kangaroo and a scout!

I was born in Australia in 2017 and as a young kangaroo I joined up with my friend [Kev Kanga](https://www.facebook.com/KevKanga) and travelled via Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland to the 15th World Scout Moot in Iceland.

After an amazing week with scouts from all over the world, I left my fellow Australians and set off to Britain.

Arriving at my new home in Derby, I joined Griffin ESU. I've now been having lots of fun with the explorers at their weekly meetings.

One day I hope to travel some more and visit scouts in other countries.
