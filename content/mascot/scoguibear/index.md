The unstealable club mascot of SCOGUI - Loughborough University.

Scogui Bear was created by Elizabeth Neat for the 1982 Summer Rally (June 24th-26th) and was the club's first official mascot. Members take it in turns to look after Scogui Bear, though he does like to go on his own adventures - usually to former memberâ€™s weddings!
