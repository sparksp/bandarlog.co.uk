When [SSAGO](https://www.ssago.org/) Clubs attend a Rally they often bring their mascots along, but there is a history of club mascots being stolen. The only way for a club mascot to be returned is for the club concerned to perform a forfeit of some sort.  Some clubs have valuable, "unstealable" mascots who have usually been with the club for a very long time, they have additional mascots that can be stolen.
